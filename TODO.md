# MCP Learning - TODO List

## Calendar MCP Server Project

### Phase 1: Planning & Design
- [ ] Decide on calendar storage approach (in-memory vs Java app)
- [ ] Learn MCP Prompts and Resources concepts
- [ ] Design calendar MCP server API (tools: add event, list events, delete event, update event)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement basic calendar MCP server with core tools
- [ ] Add MCP resources to expose calendar data
- [ ] Add MCP prompts for common calendar operations

### Phase 3: Testing & Integration
- [ ] Test calendar MCP server with Claude client
- [ ] Learn and implement MCP sampling for natural language date parsing

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Build agentic workflows for complex calendar operations

### Phase 5: Optional Enhancements
- [ ] (Optional) Replace in-memory storage with Java application backend

## Notes

**Current Approach**: Starting with MCP server only (in-memory or JSON storage) to focus on learning MCP concepts.

**Future Enhancement**: Later migrate to Java application backend for production use with proper database persistence.
