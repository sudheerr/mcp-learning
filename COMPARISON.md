- 🔄 You're making many quick queries

### Use **Ollama** if:
- 🔒 Privacy is critical (medical, legal, sensitive data)
- 💰 You want zero API costs
- 📡 You need offline capability
- 🎓 You're learning and experimenting
- 🏠 Running on local data only

### Use **ALL THREE** if:
- 🧪 You're learning about LLMs and MCP
- 🔬 You want to compare responses
- 🎯 Different tasks have different needs

## Cost Analysis (1000 Queries)

Assuming average query uses ~1000 tokens:

| Provider | Model | Cost per Query | 1000 Queries |
|----------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Claude | Sonnet 3.5 | $0.006 | $6.00 |
| ChatGPT | GPT-4o | $0.005 | $5.00 |
| ChatGPT | GPT-3.5-turbo | $0.001 | $1.00 |
| Ollama | Any local model | $0.00 | $0.00 |

**Electricity cost for Ollama:** ~$0.10-0.50 for 1000 queries (very rough estimate)

**Still way cheaper than cloud!**

## Performance Tips

### For Claude:
```bash
# Let Claude decide when to use tools - it's very good at this
node mcp-client.js "Tell me about my system"
```

### For ChatGPT:
```bash
# Works well with natural questions
node mcp-client-openai.js "What are my system specs?"

# Try different models
# Edit mcp-client-openai.js line 66:
# model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"  // Faster, cheaper
# model: "gpt-4o"         // Best quality
```

### For Ollama:
```bash
# Be explicit about tool use
node mcp-client-ollama.js "Use the get_system_info tool to check my computer"

# Try better models for tool use
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b node mcp-client-ollama.js "Check my system info"

# With GPU (if you have one), much faster!
```

## The Beauty of MCP

**Same MCP Server, Three Different AIs!**

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
                    │   Your MCP   │
                    │    Server    │
                    │ (sys-info)   │
                    └──────┬───────┘
                           │
            ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
            │              │              │
      ┌─────▼────┐   ┌────▼─────┐   ┌───▼──────┐
      │  Claude  │   │ ChatGPT  │   │  Ollama  │
      │  Client  │   │  Client  │   │  Client  │
      └──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘
```

- ✅ Write tools once
- ✅ Use with any LLM
- ✅ Switch providers anytime
- ✅ No vendor lock-in

## Try This Experiment

Run the same query on all three and compare:

```bash
QUERY="Analyze my system's memory usage and CPU specs"

echo "Testing Claude..."
node mcp-client.js "$QUERY"

echo -e "\n\nTesting ChatGPT..."
node mcp-client-openai.js "$QUERY"

echo -e "\n\nTesting Ollama..."
node mcp-client-ollama.js "Use the get_system_info tool. $QUERY"
```

Compare:
- ⏱️  Speed
- 📝 Response quality
- 💰 Cost (Claude/ChatGPT only)
- 🎯 How well they used tools

---

## Recommended Setup

**For most users:**
1. **Start with Ollama** - it's free and teaches you how everything works
