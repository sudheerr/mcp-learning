> i want to try to run the test manually, after starting the server using "node index.js", can I access the API
using browser? similar to how java apis are accessed , e.g.  http://localhost:80/get-system-info

● No, you can't access this MCP server via a browser. MCP servers use stdio (standard input/output), not HTTP. They
  communicate through JSON-RPC messages on stdin/stdout, not HTTP endpoints.

  This is fundamentally different from REST APIs:
  - REST API: HTTP server listening on a port (e.g., localhost:8080)
  - MCP Server: Reads from stdin, writes to stdout

  If you want to test manually, you need to pipe JSON messages to the running server:

  # Start server and pipe a command to it:
  echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"cl
  ientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}}}' | node index.js

  But this only allows one request before the server exits.

  If you want HTTP access, you'd need to create a different server using Express or similar. Would you like me to
  create an HTTP wrapper around the MCP server so you can access it via browser at
  http://localhost:3000/get-system-info?

> what is the ideal way to run these servers in real world?

● In the real world, MCP servers are designed to run as background processes managed by MCP clients like Claude
  Desktop, not as standalone services.

  Typical MCP Server Deployment

  1. Claude Desktop Integration (most common)
  - Add server to Claude Desktop's config file
  - Claude Desktop automatically starts/stops the server when needed
  - Server runs only when Claude is using it

  Configuration example:
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "system-info": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["/path/to/system-info-server/index.js"]
      }
    }
  }

  2. Other MCP Clients
  - IDEs with MCP support
  - Custom applications using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk client
  - CLI tools that need AI assistance with contextual tools

  3. NPM Package Distribution
  For easier installation:
  npm install -g system-info-server
  Then configure:
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "system-info": {
        "command": "system-info-server"
      }
    }
  }

  Why stdio instead of HTTP?

  - Security: No exposed ports, no network access
  - Simplicity: Client manages lifecycle (start/stop)
  - Local-first: MCP servers are meant for local tool execution
  - Process isolation: Each client gets its own server instance

  When you might want HTTP

  If you need HTTP access for web apps or external tools, you'd build a separate HTTP API that either:
  1. Calls MCP servers internally, or
  2. Implements the same functionality directly as REST endpoints

  The MCP protocol is specifically designed for AI assistants to access local tools securely.
